1) This index is 10 because the highest number of days is 10. If we put the index under it
won't have enough capacity to store all the value or over would be a waste of memory.

2) Array gives you the advantage of storing multiple values in a single variable. However, 
you are unable to see though values if you do not know them from the beginning. Moreover,
it's more complicated compared to the normal declaration.

3) I think the homework part requires a very good understanding of the subject we studied 
that make it hard but rewarding when finished. Still I myself can only finish 80-90% the 
at home part most of the time which make the last 10-20% extremely frustrating for me.
