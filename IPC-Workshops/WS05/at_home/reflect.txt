1) I think in most situation array of struct is much better than parallel array. Array
of struct is easier to manage since it a combination of array you dont to deal with one 
by one changes. secondly, if you want to full out the information from struct its also
fast than doing one by one with parallel array.

2) Since program is running from top to bottom, its better to declare struct on top since
it clarify about what you prepare and want to do with your program. It also help others
read your code.
