1- if we were having another funtion to display the contact having struct contact will
make it easier to make that funtion instead of having to use each struct to print each
information.

2- wrong syntax is still one of the problem i got. like using *ptr instead of (*ptr),
when you have "&" in scanf and when u dont need it and so on.

3- i finish all the general stuff in 3-4hours but having to wait a few days to ask 
teachers for some problem i had.
