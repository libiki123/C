1-  i think there are more efficient ways. In my opinion, we can get the user information
by merging the full name, address and lets the user enter at once.

2- In oder to determine the length of string we need a terminator '\0' at the end of
string, so with a 7 characters word we will have the 7 character + '\0' = 8 index in 
total.
