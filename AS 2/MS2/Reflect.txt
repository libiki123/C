- funtions are like part of your body and main funtion is the brain. The brain control
the whole body and funtions as in legs, arms... give the brain access as control it at
will. funtions give the the brain power to do things it cant do itself.
- we need funtions b/c it keep our code oraganize and easy to read and like our body
the brain itself cant do everything that when funtions come in to help the brain do it.

are more relate to each other close and things that isnt connect seperate, this help our
code easier too read as well as fixing it.
